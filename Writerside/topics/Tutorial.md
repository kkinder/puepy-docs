# Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through the first few steps using PuePy. It isn't necessarily a comprehensive guide to every
feature, but by the time you finish it, you should have a good understanding of how to develop web apps using PuePy.
Examples from this tutorial are hosted on [PyScript.com](https://pyscript.com), where you can sign up for a free account
and clone examples,
right in your browser, for your own experimentation.

<tip>
All examples use the MicroPython runtime, but can be easily switched to the Pyodide runtime simply be
replacing <code>type="mpy"</code> with <code>type="py"</code> in each example's <code>script</code> tag.

## Before we start

Each example in this tutorial typically contains a `.html` file, which is usually of little importance, and a `.py`
file, which contains the relevant code. For the sake of brevity, we'll usually only discuss the `.py` files and provide
relevant code from them, but each fully working example has all relevant files in the PuePy Tutorial project on
PyScript.com:

- [Tutorial Code](https://pyscript.com/@kkinder/puepy-tutorial/latest)
- [Working demos](https://kkinder.pyscriptapps.com/puepy-tutorial/latest/)

To follow this tutorial, you should have a working understanding of Python, basic web technology, and programming. No
