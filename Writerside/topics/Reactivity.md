# Reactivity

Reactivity is a paradigm that causes the user interface to update automatically in response to changes in the
application state. Rather than triggering updates manually as a programmer, you can be assured that the application
state will trigger redraws, with new information, as needed. Reactivity in PuePy is inspired by Vue.js.

## State
### Initial state

Components (including Pages) define initial state through the `initial()` method:

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    def initial(self):
        return {
            "name": "Monty ... Something?",
            "movies": ["Monty Python and the Holy Grail"]
        }
```

### Modifying state

If any method on the component changed the name, it would trigger a UI refresh:

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    def update_name(self):
        # This triggers a refresh
        self.state["name"] = "Monty Python"
```

#### Modifying mutable objects in-place

<warning>
PuePy's reactivity works by using dictionary <code>__setitem__</code> and <code>__delitem__</code> methods. As such, it
cannot detect "nested" updates or changes to mutable objects in the state. If your code will result in a state change
such as a data structure being changed in-place, you must a <code>mutate()</code> context manager.
</warning>

Modifying complex (mutable) data structures in place without **setting them** will not work:

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    def update_movies(self):
        # THIS WILL NOT CAUSE A UI REFRESH!
        self.state["movies"].append("Monty Python’s Life of Brian")
```

Instead, use a context manager to tell the state object what is being modified. This is ideal anyway.

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    def update_movies(self):
        # THIS WILL NOT CAUSE A UI REFRESH!
        with self.state.mutate("movies"):
            self.state["movies"].append("Monty Python’s Life of Brian")
```

`mutate(*keys)` can be called with any number of keys you intend to modify. As an added benefit, the state change will
only call listeners after the context manager exits, making it ideal also for "batching up" changes.

## Controlling UI Refresh

### Disabling Automatic Refresh

By default, any detected mutations to a component's state will trigger a UI fresh. This can be customized. To disable
automatic refresh entirely, set `redraw_on_changes` to False.

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    # The UI will no longer refresh on state changes
    redraw_on_changes = False
    
    def something_happened(self):
        # This can be called to manually refresh this component and its children
        self.trigger_redraw()
        
        # Or, you can redraw the whole page
        self.page.trigger_redraw()
```

### Limiting Automatic Refresh

Suppose that you want to refresh the UI on some state changes, but not others.

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    # When items in this this change, the UI will be redrawn
    redraw_on_changes = ["items"]
```

## Watching for changes

You can watch for changes in state yourself.

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    def initial():
        return {"spam": "eggs"}
    
    def on_spam_change(self, new_value):
        print("New value for spam", new_value)
```

Or, watch for any state change:

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    def on_state_change(self, key, value):
        print(key, "was set to", value)
```

## Binding form element values to state

For your convenience, the `bind` parameter can be used to automatically establish a two-way connection between
input elements and component state. When the value of a form element changes, the state is updated. When the state
is updated, the corresponding form tag's value reflects that change.

```Python
class MyComponent(Component):
    def initial(self):
        return {"name": ""}
    
    def populate(self):
        # bind specifies what key on self.state should be tied to this input's value
        t.input(placeholder="Type your name", bind="name")
```
