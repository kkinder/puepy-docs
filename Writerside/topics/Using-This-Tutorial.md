# Using This Tutorial

Each of the examples in this tutorial can be run on PyScript.com, a web environment that lets you write, test, and share
PyScript code. Alternatively, you can clone the [PuePy git repo](https://github.com/kkinder/puepy) and run a live web
server with each example included.

The PyScript.com environment uses the PuePy `.whl` file, as [downloadable from PyPi](https://github.com/kkinder/puepy),
while the examples in the git repository are served with PuePy directly from source files on disk.

## Using PyScript.com

Navigate to [https://pyscript.com/@kkinder/puepy-tutorial/latest](https://pyscript.com/@kkinder/puepy-tutorial/latest)
and you are greeted with a list of files on the left, a code editor in the middle, and a running example on the left.
Each chapter in the tutorial corresponds with a directory in `tutorial` folder on the left.

You can clone the entire examples project and edit it yourself to continue your learning:

Once cloned you make your own changes and experiment with them in real time.

## Editing locally

After cloning [puepy on git](https://github.com/kkinder/puepy), you can run the examples using a simple script:

As you edit them in the `examples` folder and reload the window, your changes will be live.
